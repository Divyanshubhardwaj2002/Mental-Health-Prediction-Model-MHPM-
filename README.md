Mental health (MH) is a pressing global concern, closely tied to anxiety, depression, and even fatal outcomes. The complex interplay between an individual's personal, social, and economic circumstances has a profound impact on their mental wellbeing. This research aims to leverage Deep Learning and AI-ML algorithms to accurately assess an individual's mental health. By developing a predictive model that integrates AI-driven analytics and ML-based algorithms, this research work seeks to identify early warning signs of mental health issues and inform data-driven interventions. The ultimate goal is to ensure the safety and wellbeing of individuals by providing a proactive and personalized approach to mental health management, thereby reducing the risk of adverse outcomes. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset incorporated with a range of factors and parameters, including sleep patterns and disturbances, appetite changes and fluctuations, interest and pleasure in activities, fatigue and low energy levels, worthlessness and guilt feelings, concentration difficulties and cognitive impairment, agitation and restlessness, suicidal ideation and behaviours, sleep disturbance and insomnia, aggression and irritability, panic attacks and anxiety episodes, hopelessness and despair, and restlessness and agitation etc. A Mixed-Methods Approach (MMA) is employed, combining quantitative and qualitative data to develop a comprehensive understanding of mental health outcomes. Model is trained using Logistic Regression (LR) , K-NN Classifier (KNN), Decision Tree Classifier (DT), Random Forest (RF), validated using the dataset, with a focus on accuracy, precision, and recall. The expected outcomes include a novel, multimodal approach to mental health assessment that integrates AI and ML, a predictive model that is Mental Health Prediction Model (MHP) which can identify early warning signs of mental health issues with accuracy-98%, and a framework for data-driven interventions that can be tailored to individual needs and circumstances.
